    text: `Kinimalism - is creativity through the movement of absolute form.

Kinimalism recognizes movement as the fundamental basis of the work and brings minimalism to the original vector form, which allows one to describe an autonomous quantum of movement.

Movement becomes form. At the same time, the form of the work ceases to have any objectivity, existing for the viewer as an exact mathematical description of the form and its movement. The work has no dimensions and is not affected by time.`,
